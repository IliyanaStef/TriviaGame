# TriviaGame - Passion 4 Fashion

This is a Trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out. The player has 20 seconds to answer each question, 10 questions total.

If the player selects the correct answer, a screen will appear showing the image with the correct answer. After a few seconds, next question will display without user input.

The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs:

  * If the player runs out of time, the game will tell the player that time's up. After a few seconds, the next question will show.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, the correct answer text will be displayed. After a few seconds, the next question will show.

On the final screen it will be displayed the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, unanswered questions and a button to restart the game.
